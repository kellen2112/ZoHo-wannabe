            <p>"Great for a small business who doesn't have a budget for
                 CRM yet and needs somewhere to store information and
                search it later. I have used Zoho CRM with inside and
                outside sales teams together. It was simple enough for
                the inside team to look up an account that calls in
                to see if they've had contact with an outside rep,
                and vice versa."
